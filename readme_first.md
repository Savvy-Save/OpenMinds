# Project Development Guidelines (for AI Assistant or Human changes)

Before making any changes to this project, please review and adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  **Prioritize Modularization:**
    *   When adding new features or significant functionality, assess if modularization is appropriate for maintainability and organization.
    *   Separate concerns into distinct CSS and JavaScript files/modules whenever beneficial. Follow the existing modular structure in the `css/` and `js/` directories.

2.  **Modern Coding Practices:**
    *   Employ modern HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript standards.
    *   Focus on writing clean, readable, and semantic code.
    *   Consider performance and optimization best practices (e.g., efficient selectors, optimized images, minimizing DOM manipulation where possible).
    *   Ensure code is accessible (follow WCAG guidelines where applicable).

3.  **Code Cleanup and Verification:**
    *   After implementing changes, especially if errors occurred or multiple steps were involved, review the modified files.
    *   Remove any commented-out "trash code," unused variables/functions, or leftover debugging statements (like `console.log` unless specifically needed).
    *   Ensure the changes integrate correctly and do not introduce new issues. Verify functionality remains intact.

Thank you for following these guidelines to maintain the quality and structure of the project.
